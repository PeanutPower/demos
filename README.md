#Verold Demos

The Verold API, used with the Verold Studio online 3D collaboration tools, allows web designers to quickly and efficiently create interactive web-based 3D experiences. Did you see the [interactive trailer](http://findyourwaytooz.com) that Disney created for "Oz the Great and Powerful"? With our tools, you can make your own interactive 3D experiences like this at a fraction of the cost.

If you've used Verold Studio, you know how easy it is to upload 3D models, position them in a scene, and setup materials and lighting. With the new engine, you can now take that scene and add dynamic behaviour to it by writing custom THREE.js code. Professional grade CG tools running in the browser, deploying to the most widely used 3D renderer for the web.

This GitHub repository contains demos built by the Verold Team and our community. These showcase what is possible. If you feel inspired, go ahead and build your own.
